# Recommendation-system (Cap of 5 pull requests on the entire repository during the boost period.)

<h2>It would be optimal to execute this program in google colab(Execute the notebook file in that google colab),unless you wish to run it as python code which could result in some errors.</h2>

### Purpose:-
 The purpose of this system is to allow users to get recommendations for their favourite shows and a further aim for anyone to find the best possible recommendation for any item as long as its data is specified in the .csv file .

### Libraries needed for the program are:-

1. import networkx as nx
2. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
3. import pandas as pd
4. import numpy as np
5. import math as math
6. import time

### Additional features to be added:-

- [ ] Add a GUI.
- [ ] Add more features which can be connected to the file(rather than just genre).
- [ ] Add a file uploader in the GUI to allow for different files to be used as well as the option to alter the options on which the recommendations must be searched.
- [ ] Allow for a search function in GUI to allow the user to view the titles of the websites from the .csv file.
